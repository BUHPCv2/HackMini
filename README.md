# BUHPC Introductory Hackathon

This repo serves as a short 30 to 45 minute hackathon for any new members of the Boston University High Performance Computing Club as a means to show just how profound the effects of hardware aware optimizations can be even on a miniscule scale. The hackathon is largely inspired by the talk "Fastware" by Andrei Alexandrescu.
